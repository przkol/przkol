## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is PrzemysÅ‚aw and my goal is to become a junior front-end developer!

### You can see live versions of my projects below:

## [SpamBook](https://przkol.github.io/spambook/)  
My attempt at recreating Facebook's front-end with 'social media' content generation based on free web APIs. Created using create-react-app, redux and more. (See Spambook repository for more details)  

## [Pokemon App](https://pokeapp-pkolka.herokuapp.com/) 
PokeDex-like database of Pokemon, uses data provided by [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). This is my first major project in TypeScript.
